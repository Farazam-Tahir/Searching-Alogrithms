#Linear Search Algorithm:
<br/>
Assume that item is in an array in random order and we have to find an item. Then the only way to search for a target item is, to begin with, the first position and compare it to the target. If the item is at the same, we will return the position of the current item. Otherwise, we will move to the next position. If we arrive at the last position of an array and still can not find the target, we return -1. This is called the Linear search or Sequential search.

#Binary Search Algorithm:
<br/>
In a binary search, however, cut down your search to half as soon as you find the middle of a sorted list. The middle element is looked at to check if it is greater than or less than the value to be searched. Accordingly, a search is done to either half of the given list.
